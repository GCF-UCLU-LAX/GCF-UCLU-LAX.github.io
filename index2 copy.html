  UCLU Lacrosse is divided into the UCLU Mens' and UCLU Womens' Lacrosse. Apart from training sessions, the clubs act as one: all social take place together and there is also a Mixed Team, which combines the two. </br>
</br>

 Lacrosse is a fast paced, hard hitting and technical sport that develops hand to eye co-ordination skills, quick feet and good stamina. You could also be built like a mountain and enjoy the opportunity to wield a 6ft long titanium pole and hit people (in Mens'only!). </br>
</br>

 There are no skill requirements in joining and youâ€™ll always be given game time. If you are interested in joining, sign up to our mailing list below and come along to one of our 4 Give It A Go sessions. </br>

Each club has several team - so no matter what level you are, we have just the space for you develop your skills and have fun! </br>
</br>

As well as playing a bit of lacrosse, we enjoy a huge programme of social events; Sportnights every Wednesday at Loop, Crew Dates, Meals, Tour and mini tours, as well as joint club socials. </br>
</br>

Hope to see you at our next session.
